                    <i> In college admissions essays, wordiness is by far the most common stylistic error. In most cases, students could cut one-third of an essay, lose no meaningful content, and make the piece much more engaging and effective.

Wordiness comes in many forms with many different names -- deadwood, repetition, redundancy, BS, filler, fluff -- but whatever the type, those extraneous words have no place in a winning college admissions essay.  </i>

And for the one about 'talent, quality, accomplishment, experience that matters to you', I did mine on how I refused my friend's offer to level up my League of Legends account because I value getting my own achievements and learning from my own mistakes.

Your "background" can be a broad environmental factor that contributed to your development such as growing up in a military family, living in an interesting place, or dealing with an unusual family situation. Your "story" could be an event or series of events that had a profound impact on your identity. However you approach the prompt, make sure you are inward looking and explain how and why your identity was influenced by your background or story.  </i>
