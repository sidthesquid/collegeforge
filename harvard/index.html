                <i class="im-user mr5 color-gray">I wish I had gotten a second opinion or someone I trust to be completely honest involved early on in the process. I had worked on several essays before I showed anyone. It turned out that I didn't use a good number of them because the topic wasn't strong enough - an issue I could have addressed before writing the entire essays. Be open-minded to these opinions even though it's tempting to want to see your own ideas as the only usable ones. Just get something on the page down. You can easily overcome writer's block by even starting in the middle of the essay since everyone gets stuck with the first paragraph. Start by telling the story and then going back to craft that perfect opening. </i>

                <i class="im-user mr5 color-gray">For both my Common App and UC prompt #1, I picked a similar topic and was able to recycle the majority of the writing for both. I wrote about the environment I flourish in - one with very driven individuals - and listed examples from experience with Key Club, DECA, and two difference economics summer programs. For the second UC prompt, I wrote about my experience speaking in front of the city council to continue to secure funds for the local swim team instead of stop funding it completely. ** I only applied to colleges on the Common App and the UC application. **</i>

                <i class="im-user mr5 color-gray">If you're going to go to interviews, make sure that you have some points you know you want to go over beforehand. Pick topics that really show your passions and character so you'll be ready to share whenever there's an opportunity. Every interviewer starts the interview with some sort of variation of "Tell me about yourself" - make sure you know what points you'll discuss, but don't sound rehearsed. Good luck seniors! Don't stress out too much about the process - it can even be an enriching one with the right mindset. I definitely did a lot of soul-searching to find out who I am and what I'm passionate about to answer these prompts. Take this opportunity to learn more about yourself and your aspirations and then just reflect that in your essays to let the admissions officers know how unique and awesome you are.</i>
