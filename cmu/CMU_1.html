By the time  they process the thousands of pieces of information that come in on the final day, the actual deadline has come and gone, and it's possible that something is still missing. They try to give a few days' grace period, but colleges and universities expect you to confirm that your application has been received and that it is complete. </i>

                <i class="im-user mr5 color-gray">  Be controversial (if you can). So many kids write bland essays that don't take a stand on anything. It is fine to write about politics, religion, something serious, as long as you are balanced and thoughtful. Don't pretend you have the final truth. And don't just get up on your soapbox and spout off on a sensitive subject; instead, give reasons and arguments for your view and consider other perspectives (if appropriate). Colleges are places for the discussion of ideas, and admissions officers look for diversity of mind. <br>

 Be smart. Colleges are intellectual places, a fact they almost always keep a secret when they talk about their dorms, climbing walls, and how many sports you can play. It is helpful to show your intellectual vitality. What turns your mind on? This is not the same thing as declaring an intended major; what matters is why that subject interests you.</i>
