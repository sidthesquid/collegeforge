                    <i> Be an individual. In writing the essay, ask yourself, "How can I distinguish myself from those thousands of others applying to College X whom I don't knowâ€”and even the ones I do know?" It's not in your activities or interests. If you're going straight from high school to college, you're just a teenager, doing teenage things. It is your mind and how it works that are distinctive. How do you think? Sure, that's hard to explain, but that's the key to the whole exercise.</i>

                <i class="im-user mr5 color-gray">Using spell-check isn't enough, you have to proofread. Julie Taymor, who wrote and directed "The Lion King," is a graduate of Oberlin, and the University had a student who was really passionate about [Taymor's] work and wrote a really well-done essay about it. But she neglected to proof it, and throughout she referred to the musical as "The Loin King." 

She didn't get in. It wasn't just because of that; it didn't help, though. It was a really good essay, but that just put the pause button on it. </i>
