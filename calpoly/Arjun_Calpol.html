                <i class="im-user mr5 color-gray"> To be honest, I am not completely sure what I can suggest considering I didn't get into any of the colleges I was realistically hoping for. Just remember to push yourself in school, but don't forget that you're only going to be in high school once. Don't let society always telling you that you need to go to a good school consume your life. I have a friend that graduated from Arizona State (one of the most well known party schools) that is now working at Tesla, and another from Chico State (another party school) who is now working for JP Morgan. I'm not saying don't study, because having a degree from a well known school will give you an advantage when you're first finding a job, and getting rejected from schools that many of your closest friends are going to is not a fun feeling.
<br>
But basically, tldr version: find a balance in your life, study hard, try new things, and just enjoy being a kid while it lasts.</i>
